# Readability

## Specification

Design and implement a program, readability, that computes the Coleman-Liau index of the text.

- Implement your program in a file called readability.c in a directory called readability.
- Your program must prompt the user for a string of text (using get_string).
- Your program should count the number of letters, words, and sentences in the text. You may assume that a letter is any lowercase character from a to z or any uppercase character from A to Z, any sequence of characters separated by spaces should count as a word, and that any occurrence of a period, exclamation point, or question mark indicates the end of a sentence.
- Your program should print as output "Grade X" where X is the grade level computed by the Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer.
- If the resulting index number is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output "Grade 16+" instead of giving the exact index number. If the index number is less than 1, your program should output "Before Grade 1".

# Substitution

## Specification

Design and implement a program, substitution, that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher.

- Implement your program in a file called substitution.c in a directory called `substitution.
- Your program must accept a single command-line argument, the key to use for the substitution. The key itself should be case-insensitive, so whether any character in the key is uppercase or lowercase should not affect the behavior of your program.
- If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print an error message of your choice (with printf) and return from main a value of 1 (which tends to signify an error) immediately.
- If the key is invalid (as by not containing 26 characters, containing any character that is not an alphabetic character, or not containing each letter exactly once), your program should print an error message of your choice (with printf) and return from main a value of 1 immediately.
- Your program must output plaintext: (without a newline) and then prompt the user for a string of plaintext (using get_string).
- Your program must output ciphertext: (without a newline) followed by the plaintext’s corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext substituted for the corresponding character in the ciphertext; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.
- Your program must preserve case: capitalized letters must remain capitalized letters; lowercase letters must remain lowercase letters.
- After outputting ciphertext, you should print a newline. Your program should then exit by returning 0 from main.
